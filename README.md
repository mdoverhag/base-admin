# Greenfield React Project

This projects is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and adds a few useful libraries and wrappers to quickly get started with a React App.


## Added libraries / components

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - written in TypeScript because the more issues we can address at compile time without having to exercise the components the better

[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)/[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)/[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - because it helps improve readability and catches errors

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - adds simple routing boilerplate

[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - layouts and components

[Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/)/[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (not yet) - productive form handling

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)/[Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) (not yet) - add boilerplate


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
